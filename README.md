# ShapeApp

ShapeApp is a SWING based GUI for drawing circles, squares and rectangles on a canvas. There are interactive sliders for circle radius, square side length and rectangle height/width. There is also an option to select the colour of the shape being drawn. The shape is drawn when the mouse is clicked on the canvas.

All code is written in Java, following instructions written by Martin Holloway (Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London) for the Programming 3 module.

Source code can be viewed in the src/main/java folder.
